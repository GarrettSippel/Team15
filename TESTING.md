Bow-Wow Ball
Our vision is to make an addictive game that is initially easy to understand and gradually becomes more intellectually challenging.

Automated Tests:
To run these tests, go into the unity project, open the Window tab, and navigate to test runner. Once the test runner window is open, go to the editor mode tests tab and select run all tests. The output will be as such if the tests pass.
 
User Acceptance Tests:
	We made unit tests to check the functionality of three game objects. We check to make sure that both the hydrant and the trashcan are activated by triggers. We do this by making new objects of both the hydrant/trashcan and a ball and making sure that if the ball is in range, a Boolean that detects the ball is set to true. We also tested to make sure that the bones get deleted when a ball object is over it.
